#This is my final CS50x project Wetherapp50. 
#With the Weatherapp50 you can get current weather information for your requested location, aswell as a
#forecast for the next 7 days. The app also contains an interactive world map, which shows you the
#location of the search request with a pin on the map.
#The Api used to get the weather information in this application is called OpenWeatherMap API.
#For the world map i used a Python library called Folium.
