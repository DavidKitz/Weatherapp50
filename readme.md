#Weather app idea
#get request will include country/region for the requested weather data
#get weather data on post request
#information from api
#Option to save requested regions to database and automatically return weather data on "/" route
#Maybe ask user for location so automatically can choose weather data based on where you are?
#USE GPS API: LOOK UP THE C50 Session where they showed how to get current location and add a route with show the weather at
#my current location
#add time and date for search history
#give option to show more details in history (redirect to index page)
