# This is my final CS50x project Wetherapp50.
## With the Weatherapp50 you can get the current weather information for your requested location, as well as a forecast for the next 7 days. When such a weather-location request is sent, the server queries the OpenWeatherMap API for the information requested by the user. The returned data includes: weather condition, current temperature, sunrise time, sunset time as well as the current local time.
## The app also contains an interactive world map, which shows you the location of the search request with a pin on the map. This is done by using a Python library called Folium, which allowed me to include a visualization of the data.
## In the Weatherapp50 you can also view your search history, which is represented in a table, with information about your request as well as the option to get more detailed information. Furthermore, I added the option to view all the past search requests on the world map which are represented with the corresponding pins on each location.
## The Api used to get the weather information in this application is called OpenWeatherMap API. To add your API Key to the enviroment you need to type "export API_KEY=value" (value = your personal API Key) in the console.
## For the world map i used a Python library called Folium.
